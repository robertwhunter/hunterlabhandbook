Transfer 5 ml to T25 for a sterility test. 2.2.2 Thawing To thaw: transfer 10 ml medium to a centrifuge tube and incubate @ 37deg use 500 mcl aliquots of medium to thaw cells over 10 mins (i.e. squirt in 500 mcl, pipette up and down, transfer to 10 ml and repeat) spin to pellet cells (1000 rpm for 5 mins = 290 g??), remove supernatant and re-suspend in 1 ml add this to 9 ml in a T25 2.2.3 Splitting To split: remove medium and discard wash x2 with PBS incubate with trypsin-EDTA (e.g. 1 ml for T75) @ 37deg for 10 - 15 mins until detatched inactivate with 10 vols medium (e.g. 10 ml for T75) spin to pellet cells, discard supernatant and top up to desired volume with medium split as desired (using haematocytometer to count cells if required) 2.2.4 Freezing To freeze: trypsinise cells and spin down re-suspend in 10 % DMSO (filtered) in FCS and freeze as 1 ml aliquots in screw-top tubes transfer to – 80deg in ‘Mr. Frosty’ chamber immediately and leave for 24 hrs move to liquid nitrogen within a few days "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
