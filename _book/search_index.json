The method relies on: an alcohol to deplete the hydration shell from nucleic acids; a salt supplying monovalent cations to neutralise negatively-charged phosphate groups on the nucleic acid backbone; +/- an inert carrier to act as a co-precipitant. The choice of reagent for each of these three steps will influence the results. Alcohol: ethanol (C2H6O): more volatile (i.e. quicker air-drying) more polar (i.e. fewer salts co-precipitated c.f. isopropanol) isopropanol (C3H8): more efficient (therefore use half volume c.f. EtOH) Salt: sodium acetate (CH3COONa): used for most routine applications NaCl: use if samples contain SDS ammonium acetate: reduces co-precipitation of dNTPs / oligos LiCl: high purity of RNA but loss of small RNAs; exploited to purify large RNAs Carrier: glycogen can carry small RNAs (&gt; 8 nt) linear polyacrylamide does NOT carry small RNAs (&lt;= 20 nt) yeast tRNA may inhibit down-stream reactions salmon sperm DNA Other variables such as temperature, the inclusion of Mg salts and the starting concentration of nucleic acid may also influence the result. Temperature Historically, EtOH precipitation was carried out at very low temperatures (e.g. in dry ice / EtOH bath), but this is not strictly necessary and precipitation will occur @ 0 °. Indeed, there are theoretical reasons why precipitation efficiency should diminish as temperature falls (increased dielectic constrant of the alcohol-aqueous solution, reduced movement of nucleic acids, reduced solubility and therefore increased co-precipitation of contaminating salts). Magnesium Mg2+ ions stabilise RNA-RNA interactions. The inclusion of MgCl (final concentration 10 mM) increased recovery of miRNA from cell lysates – although this was added during RNA extraction protocol (e.g. QIAzol) rather than during EtOH precipitation (Kim et al., 2012). Abundance of nucleic acid Recover of miRNA was lower when the starting abundance of total RNA was low, suggesting that small RNAs might depend on larger RNAs as carriers (Kim et al., 2012). 3.2 Materials Use DEPC aq. 1M MgCl2 3M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 100% EtOH 70% EtOH glycogen 20 mg/ml (Thermo R0551) resuspension buffer (2 mM DTT; 1 mcl per 20 mcl RNaseOUT TM in DEPC aq) RNaseOUTTM: add 1 mcl per 20 mcl RNA solution (= 40 units); requires 1 mM DTT to retain activity 3.3 Method: alcohol precipitation suitable for small RNAs The following protocol should be suitable for total RNA, preserving small RNAs.

In my hands, three alternative methods of RNA preparation (solution D, TRIzol and RNeasy spin columns) appear to work equally well. However, this is all adapted from the classic single-step method of RNA extraction by combined guinidinium thiocyante with phenol-chloroform extraction under acidic conditions (Chomczynski &amp; Sacchi, 2006). The acid pH is crucial – see my notes on phenol-chloroform extraction. Therefore Chomczynski &amp; Sacchi use water-saturated (NOT buffered) phenol. Which reagent to use? TRIzol, TRI reagent (AM9738), TRIsure (38033) and QIAzol are all monophasic solutions of phenol / guanidine thiocyanate that facilitate rapid isolation of RNA (partitions to aqueous phase), DNA (to interphase) and protein (to organic phase) (Rio et al., 2010). QIAzol has been optimised for use in fatty tissues (adipose / brain). Bromochloropropane may be used as a less toxic alternative to chloroform (Chomczynski &amp; Mackey, 1995). TRIzol-LS is optimised for liquid samples. Phase-lock gel tubes (such as MaxTract high density tubes) are compatible with TRIzol and QIAzol. The nucleic acid partitions to the aqueous phase (so presumably this might increase the amount of gDNA contamination). Maybe best used at the very end of a protocol to clean up final RNA sample. Silica columns An alternative to organic phase extraction is to use silica columns (see below). Cost-effective “home-made” protocols seem to work well (Escobar &amp; Hunt, 2017). Direct-zolTM kits offer a rapid, column-based protocol that avoids the need for phase separation (which can apparently bias miRNA extraction). miRNA extraction There are important features to note when considering extraction of small RNAs / miRNAs. The amount of starting material and the isolation method have the greatest potential to bias any results. For example: structured small RNAs with low-GC content (including miRNA, pre-miRNA, tRNA…) are selectively lost during TRIzol extraction (c.f. mirVana miRNA kit) (Kim et al., 2012) Mg2+ can enhance miRNA recovery, presumably by stabilising interactions with carrier long RNA – reverse seen with EDTA (ibid) miRCURYTM kit recovers highly pure RNA but miRNA was selectively lost at increasing quantities of input material (El-Khoury et al., 2016) miRNeasy kit recovers less pure RNA but more miRNA (ibid) miRNeasy is better than miRCURYTM at recovering miRNA / small RNAs from cells and exosomes (plasma &amp; urine) (ibid) some miRNAs were selectively lost by either kit (ibid) TRIzol recovered low-purity RNA with detrimental effects on downstream applications (ibid) their purity of RNA using miRNeasy kit was higher than has been reported by other investigators – perhaps because they used PLG tubes (ibid); they also obtained higher recovery when using MS2 (bacteriophage) RNA to mix with Qiazol as carrier some investigators have reported better yields with the addition of a carrier (e.g. 5 mcg glycogen) to samples in TRIzol before input into miRNeasy columns (Duy et al., 2015) Conclusions: for high-quality miRNA preparations, prefer: miRNeasy kit (with use of PLG tubes) +/- glycogen standardised abundance of starting material 5.2 Materials (for ‘solution D’ method) 0.75 M Na citrate, pH 7 trisodium citrate dehydrate (MW 294.1) 17.65 g DEPC aq to 70 ml pH to 7.0; top up to 80 ml autoclave 2 M Na acetate, pH 4 sodium acetate 21.78 g DEPC aq to 50 ml pH to 4.0 with concentrated HCl; top up to 80 ml autoclave solution D (50 ml) guanidine thiocyanate 25 g = 4M DEPC aq 30.6 ml 0.75 M Na citrate, pH 7 1.76 ml = 25 mM sarcosyl 20 % 1.32 ml = 0.5 % stir @ 65 º until dissolved store for up to 3 months @ RT º (protect from the light; discard if yellows) to each 400 mcl, add immediately before use: β-mercaptoethanol (14.4M) 2.9 mcl = 100 mM chloroform:isoamylalcohol 49:1 water-saturated phenol 5.3 Method (‘solution D’) dissolve samples in 400 mcl solution D with βME lyse samples (e.g. by vortexing or passing through a 21G needle) sit @ RT for 5 min for complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes (but for NOT more than 30 mins) ii) add 40 mcl 2M Na acetate, pH 4.0 mix well by inversion and centrifuge for 15 s iii) add 400 mcl phenol (water-saturated) mix well by inversion and centrifuge for 15 s iv) add 80 mcl chloroform:isoamylalcohol (49:1) mix well by inversion and centrifuge for 15 s v) vortex vigorously × 10 s incubate on ice × 15’ spin @ 10,000 g × 20’ @ 4 º proceed with alcohol precipitation 5.4 Method (QIAzol®) QIAzol® (a monophasic solution of guanidinium and phenol) may be used in a protocol that is directly analogous to the classic “solution D” protocol. Alternatively, RNA can be extracted using RNeasy® Kits, in which silica membrane technology is used to remove residual phenol (that can interfere with RNA quantitation and downstream applications). dissolve samples in 400 mcl Qiazol (e.g. for 40 mg tissue) lyse samples (e.g. by vortexing or passing through a 21G needle) sit @ RT for 5 min for complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes (but for NOT more than 30 mins) ii) add 80 mcl chloroform shake vigorously × 15 s incubate at RT × 2-3’ spin @ 12,000 g × 15’ @ 4 º salvage aqueous phase vi) proceed with alcohol precipitation RNA purity can be improved by (Toni et al., 2018): repeating chloroform extraction step x1 (so done twice in total) repeating 75% EtOH washes x2 (so done three times in total) 5.5 References Chomczynski P &amp; Mackey K (1995).

Plasmid DNA may then be purified by column chromatography. Commercial kits are available to perform both of the above. ALKALINE LYSIS WITH SDS Exposure of bacterial suspensions to a strongly anionic detergent at high pH ruptures the cells and denatures proteins and chromosomes. The cell walls, proteins and chromosomal DNA become enmeshed in large complexes that are coated with dodecyl sulphate. When potassium ions are added (to replace sodium ions), these complexes precipitate out, leaving plasmid DNA in solution. Therefore plasmid DNA can be recovered from the supernatant after centrifugation. During the lysis phase, the alkaline pH completely disrupts base-pairing. However, stands of closed circular plasmid DNA are unable to separate from each other as they are topologically intertwined. The DNA strands fall back into register when the pH returns to normal (provided that the duration and / or intensity of OH – exposure is not too great). COLUMN CHROMATOGRAPHY Most kits use resins capable of ion-exchange / adsorption interaction chromatography. This process exploits the propensity of DNA to bind to silica in the presence of chaotropic salts. These salts are thought to dehydrate the sugar-phosphate backbone of dsDNA, permitting exposed PO4 3– residues to adsorb to the silicate matrix. Once adsorbed, the dsDNA cannot be eluted by solvents (e.g. 50 % EtOH) that displace other biopolymers such as RNA and carbohydrates. When the dsDNA is rehydrated by washing with an aqueous buffer (e.g. TE / H2O) then it can be recovered in the effluent. The adsorption of dsDNA to the silicate matrix is independent of base composition and topology (and therefore this method can be used to purify circular plasmid or long linear DNA) but is dependant on DNA fragment length. Fragments less then 100 – 200 bp adsorb poorly to the resin and this method is not suitable for their purification. COMBINED KIT Commercial kits differ in the chemical composition of the binding resin (which is usually supplied pre-packed in columns) and the chemical reagents used with them. Most protocols include the following steps: i) grow E. coli to sufficient numbers ii) harvest bacteria by centrifuging and re-suspending pellet (to form a homogenous cell suspension) iii) lyse cells (with alkaline lysis with SDS) iv) prepare DNA and column for chromatography v) bind DNA to binding resin vi) wash other biopolymers away vii) elute DNA viii) concentrate DNA (if required) 7.1 Growing E. coli (5 ml culture) Have naked flame to sterilise glassware. i) dispense 5 ml LB-broth into 50 ml falcon tube ii) add antibiotics e.g. ampicillin 100 μg ml –1 (= 5 μl of 100 mg ml –1 stock) or kanamicin 12.5 μg ml –1 (= 1.25 μl of 50 mg ml –1 stock) iii) select single E. coli colony from agar plate (or use wire loop to draw from glycerol stock) iv) loosely fit lid (to allow gas exchange for bacteria) and secure with tape v) incubate @ 37° × c. 200 rpm × c. 6 hrs8 7.2 Growing E. coli (50 ml culture) Have naked flame to sterilise glassware. i) dispense 50 ml LB-broth into 500 ml conical flask ii) add antibiotics e.g. ampicillin 100 μg ml –1 (= 50 μl of 100 mg ml –1 stock) or kanamicin 12.5 μg ml –1 (= 12.5 μl of 50 mg ml –1 stock) iii) add 5 ml culture (as made above) iv) loosely fit lid (to allow gas exchange for bacteria) and secure with tape v) incubate @ 37° × c. 200 rpm × overnight9 7.3 Plasmid preparation 7.3.1 Plasmid prep kit discard waste into virkon i) if making glycerol stocks then do so at this stage: put 200 μl cells into pre-chilled 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube add 200 μl 80 % glycerol (in LB-broth) vortex to mix transfer to – 80 ° freezer asap ii) spin overnight culture @ 3500 rpm (or g?) × 10’ @ 4 ° &gt; discard supernatant iii) prepare plasmid with kit (e.g. GenElute HP miniprep or midi-prep kit)10 7.3.2 DNA precipitation (for midipreps) iv) transfer the eluate to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube v) add 0.1 vols sodium acetate (3M, p.H 5.2) - add 0.7 vols isopropanol - mix well by inversion - spin @ 13000g × 10 mins vi) discard the supernatant (carefully) - rinse the DNA pellet with 1.5 ml 70 % EtOH - spin @ 13000g × 10 mins vii) discard the supernatant (carefully) - pulse in centrifuge and remove final few drops of EtOH - air-dry for 5 – 10 mins viii) resuspend in c. 30 – 100 μl TE - leave to stand for 5 – 10 min @ RT ° (or @ 4 ° overnight) - gently pipette up and down to mix (final mixture should be gloopy) ix) verify plasmid concentration with nanodrop spectrophotometer (remember to use TE to blank) - adjust to desired concentration (e.g. λ = 1 μg μl –1) incubate @ 32 ° for unstable plasmids↩︎ ditto↩︎ remember to ensure that the kit has been correctly prepared by adding RNase A to the resuspension solution, EtOH to wash solution 2 and that the resuspension and neutralisation solutions have been chilled↩︎ "],["mccd-culture-protocols.html", "Protocol 8 mCCD culture protocols 8.1 Materials 8.2 Methods", " Protocol 8 mCCD culture protocols 8.1 Materials 500 ml DMEM/F-12 with L-glutamine or glutmax (e.g. Lonza 12-719F) FBS (Gibco 10500) tri-iodothyronine (Sigma T5516) make a 50 mcM stock: dissolve 1mg in 1ml 1M NaOH then add 29 ml DMEM/F-12 and F.S. then dilute 1 ml in 49 ml DMEM/F-12 to give 1 mcM; store as 550 mcM aliquots dexamethasone (Sigma D8893) add 510 mcl 100% EtOH to 1 mg dexamethasone to make 5 mM stock rhEGF (Sigma E9644) make a 100 mcg/ml stock: dissolve 200 mcg in 2ml H2O and freeze as 55 mcl aliquots ITS (Gibco 41400045) pen/strep (Gibco 15140122) trypsin-EDTA (Gibco 253000054) 8.2 Methods 8.2.1 Growth medium To 500 ml DMEM/F12, add: 5 ml ITS ** 5 ml P/S ** 500 mcl T3 ** 5 mcl dexamethasone ** 10 ml FCS (don’t filter) 50 mcl rhEGF (don’t filter) ** = combine &amp; F.S.

NB ATCC documentation states that RPTEC/TERT1 cells should be grown in G418 (100 mcg / ml) in order to maintain selective pressure for immortalisation. This does not appear to be important in practice. It is not entirely clear why rpTEC-TERT1 cells are cultured in serum-free medium. This is perhaps because of historic serum-free protocols used to culture rTECs in the 1970s (Wieser et al., 2008). For the best discussion of this need to read Taub &amp; Livingston (1981). ITS was classically used to allow cells to grow in serum-free or low-serum (2-4 %) media. There are some differences in commercial formulations.
