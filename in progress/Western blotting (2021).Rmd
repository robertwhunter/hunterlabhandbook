**2021**

*Beforehand*: prepare protein samples ready for loading at store @ -80
deg

*Day 1:* PAGE and transfer; incubate with 1ry Ab overnight

*Day 2:* incubate with 2ry Ab and develop

**Samples:** set up to load up to 40 mcl per lane (and ideally c. 20
mcl)

*e.g. sample 16*

*2x tris-glycine SDS sample buffer 20*

*500 mM DTT [4]{.underline} (= final 50 mM)*

*TOTAL 40 mcl*

heat samples to 70 ° × 15'

(do NOT heat ladder)

**SDS-PAGE:** use Novex ^TM^ WedgeWell 4 -- 12% Tris-glycine gels (15
lane)

rinse with dH~2~O

make up 1L buffer for 2 chambers (= 100 ml 10x Tris-glycine running
buffer up to 1L with dH~2~O)

set up as per quick reference card

run @ 225 V × \~30 - 45'

**Transfer:** make up 500 ml transfer buffer for 1 gel

*Tris-glycine transfer buffer (25 ×) 20 ml*

*methanol 100 ml (i.e. 20 %)*

*dH~2~O to 500 ml*

soak pads in transfer buffer (and squeeze out bubbles)

pre-wet PVDF membrane in methanol for 30'' then rinse in dH~2~O and soak
in TB for a few mins

do NOT equilibrate gel in transfer buffer

pre-wet filter paper (thin paper supplied with PVDF)

assemble as per quick reference card but remember....

*wet cathode with 10 ml TB first*

*smooth with roller after each step (apply a few ml TB to wet gel or
membrane before rolling)*

transfer on Mini Blot wet transfer module @ 20 V × 60' (for PVDF)

after transfer wash membrane in 20 ml milli-Q-H~2~0 for 5' x 2

**Blot:** *wash = 0.2% TWEEN in PBS = 2 ml in 1L*

*block = 5% (w/v) milk powder = 2g in 40 ml*

block for 40 mins @ RT then 1ry Ab overnight @ 4deg

wash x 5 mins x3 then 2ry Ab for 60 mins @ RT

wash x 10 mins x3 then develop with ECL reagent

re-use 1ry Ab by salvaging into 0.05 % NaN~3~ (i.e. add 250 mcl of 1 %
NaN~3~ to 5 ml)...

...store in same container used for incubation (i.e. 50 ml falcon) @ 4 °

do NOT re-use 2ry Ab (NaN~3~ quenches HRP activity)

Can apparently post-stain with Instant Blue (Expedion) -- few mins to
stain then few mins to destain in 50% MeOH and image in IR channel.
