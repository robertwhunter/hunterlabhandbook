**Protein extraction from cells**

*This protocol describes how to lyse cells from a cell pellet from a T75
flask. The alternative is to lyse directly on 100 mm plates.*

*Put PBS and RIPA buffer (with protease inhibitors) on ice.*

i\) detach cells from T75 flask using standard protocol (EDTA washes × 2
followed by trypsinisation)

ii\) spin in tissue culture centrifuge to loosely pellet cells

aspirate supernatant and discard

resuspend pellet in 1.5 ml PBS and transfer to 2 ml eppendorf

iii\) spin @ 5500 rpm × 5'

remove supernatant and discard

iv\) wash pellet with 1 ml ice-cold PBS

spin @ 5500 rpm × 5'

remove supernatant and discard

v\) repeat step iv)

vi\) add 1 ml RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors

pipette until cells completely resuspended

pass repeatedly (c. × 5) through a 21G (green) needle

vii\) incubate on ice × 15' on rocking platform

viii\) spin @ 13000 rpm × 15' @ 4°

collect supernatant and store in aliquots (e.g. 100 mcl) @ - 20 °

(discard pellet)

ix\) measure protein concentration (e.g. with BCA protein assay reagent
kit -- in duplicate)

adjust to desired concentration prior to SDS-PAGE / Western blot

*ALTERNATIVE PROTOCOL -- LYSE DIRECTLY ON PLATE*

i\) remove medium from cells growing on one 100 mm dish (c. 7.5 × 10 ^6^
cells)

wash twice with cold PBS

ii\) add 1.5 ml cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail

incubate on ice × 5', swirling occasionally

iii\) gather lysate to one side using a cell scraper

collect lysate and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube

iv\) spin @ 13 000 g × 15' to pellet cell debris

(optional to increase yield -- sonicate pellet for 30 s with a 50 %
pulse)

v\) transfer supernatant to a fresh tube for further analysis

store in 50 mcl aliquots @ - 80 °

**RIPA buffer** NaCl (5 M) 900 mcl

NP-40 300 mcl

sodium deoxycholate 300 mg

Tris-HCl (1M, pH 7.6) 750 mcl

SDS (10 %) 300 mcl

ddH~2~O adjust to 30 ml

*store at 4 °; add 1 complete mini protease-inhibitor cocktail tablet
(Roche) per 10 ml prior to use*
