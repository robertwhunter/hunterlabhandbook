**Genomic DNA Preparation (from tail biopsy)**

**Protocol**

*Protocol is descended from that used to extract genomic DNA from mouse
tails* [^1] *(Palmiter & Brinster, 1985).*

*Tissue samples are stored @ -- 20 ° in 1.5 ml microfuge (Eppendorf)
tube.*

i\) label 1.5 ml microfuge tubes

add 600 μl tail buffer [^2] + 18 μl Proteinase K (20 mg ml ^--1^)

transfer tail tip (directly from freezer / dry ice) to appropriate tube
[^3]

snip into small chunks using sharp scissors [^4]

incubate @ 55 ° overnight on rotating rack (until ear punch is
dissolved)

ii\) add 20 μl DNA-free RNAse (20 μg ml ^--1^) [^5]

incubate @ 37 ° for 60'

iii\) add 600 μl of phenol [^6] + 6 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (in fume
hood)

place on vertical rotor (i.e. horizontal axis of rotation) for 15' [^7]

iv\) spin @ max speed (13,000 rpm) × 3'

transfer aqueous phase (+ any interphase) to a fresh microfuge tube (+
discard organic phase) [^8]

add 300 μl phenol + 300 μl chloroform : isoamyl alcohol 24:1 [^9]

place on vertical rotor (i.e. horizontal axis of rotation) for 15'

v\) spin @ max speed (13,000 rpm) × 3'

transfer aqueous phase (+ any interphase) to a fresh microfuge tube (+
discard organic phase)

add 600 μl chloroform : isoamyl alcohol 24:1

place on vertical rotor (i.e. horizontal axis of rotation) for 15'

vi\) spin @ max speed (13,000 rpm) × 3'

transfer aqueous phase (but NOT interphase) to fresh microfuge tube
[^10]

add 450 μl isopropanol [^11]

invert tube several times until a stringy precipitate forms (you may
also see bubbles)

vii\) spin @ max speed (13,000 rpm) × 10' to pellet the DNA [^12]

remove supernatant + discard [^13]

wash with EtOH (70 %) [^14] -- take care not to accidentally discard the
pellet at this stage

spin @ max speed (13,000 rpm) × 3'

remove any residual EtOH (should be a few μl only)

air dry for 5 -- 10' @ RT °

viii\) resuspend pellet in 100 μl TE (= Tris EDTA) [^15] (wash back of
tube several times ± mix by gentle vortex)

leave o/n @ 4 ° to resolubilise the pellet then incubate @ 50 -- 55 °
for 10' then mix gently the next day [^16]

store samples @ 4 ° (short-term) or -- 20 ° (long-term) [^17]

[^1]: **Notes**

    for ear punches, some people use 100 mcl tail buffer; alternative
    tissues may be used in place of an ear / tail punch; spleen is a
    good one; if mice are not fasted the night before cull, DNA
    preparation from liver will contain large amounts of glycogen as a
    white crystalline precipitate

[^2]: tail buffer (50 ml): Tris-Cl; pH 8.0 50 mM = 2.5 ml of 1 M stock

    EDTA; pH 8.0 100 mM = 10.0 ml of 0.5 M stock

    NaCl 100 mM = 1.0 ml of 5 M stock

    SDS 1 % = 2.5 ml of 20 % (v/v) stock

    dH~2~O = 34 ml

    *filter to sterilise and store @ RT °*

[^3]: if the ear punch is allowed to thaw prior to the addition of tail
    lysis buffer then enzymatic digestion of nucleic acid may occur

[^4]: take extreme care not to cross-contaminate when processing
    multiple samples -- rinse scissors with detergent, then aq, then 70
    % EtOH, then flame, then cool and wipe with tissues

[^5]: dilute RNAse A 10 mg ml^--1^ stock 1:500 in nuclease-free H~2~O --
    can use a little more than this if desired (i.e. × 3 -- 4)

[^6]: phenol has an aqueous layer on top of it in the bottle (to prevent
    the phenol oxidising) -- so ensure phenol is drawn from the lower
    pure phenol phase; ensure phenol is equilibrated to pH \~ 8.0 (this
    is best for gDNA)

[^7]: use 'sawn off' pipette tips to avoid shearing DNA at all stages
    after stage iii)

[^8]: at this stage the priority is to transfer ALL of the aqueous phase
    (i.e. it doesn't matter if this includes a little phenol); in fact
    there is a lot of DNA at the interface so try to include the
    interface (along with any hairs etc.)

[^9]: prepare 50 ml of stock (in fume cupboard) and store @ RT protected
    from light; chloroform tends to drip when pipetted --
    double-plunging when drawing it up may help (i.e. draw up, discard,
    re-draw) although don't spend too long as chloroform melts plastic

[^10]: at this stage the priority is to AVOID transferring any of the
    organic phase, as chloroform may interfere with further steps /
    PCR...

[^11]: if too much isopropanol is used then the pellet will be too
    gloopy and diffuse -- if this happens then rescue by adding more aq

[^12]: set all the tubes with the hinge at the outside of the centrifuge
    -- then you will know that the pellet is stuck to the wall of the
    tube directly beneath the hinge

[^13]: always save isopropanol / EtOH washes until the end of the
    protocol -- in case DNA accidentally discarded

[^14]: i.e. add c. 180 μl EtOH (70 %) and then set pipette to remove 200
    μl EtOH (taking care not to suck up the pellet)

[^15]: Tris EDTA (100 ml) Tris-Cl, pH 8.0 10 mM = 1 ml of 1 M stock

    EDTA, pH 8.0 1 mM = 0.2 ml of 0.5 M stock

    dH~2~O = 98.8 ml

[^16]: the DNA should be homogenous before proceeding to further
    analysis; it's best to spin briefly to pellet any un-resuspended
    material and then draw a working sample from the supernatant

[^17]: in the absence of contaminating nucleases (which should have been
    removed by phenol extraction), DNA should be stable in TE @ 4 ° for
    months -- years!
