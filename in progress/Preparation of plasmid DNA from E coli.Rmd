**Preparation of plasmid DNA from E. coli**

**Theory**

The traditional method of isolating plasmid DNA from E. coli is alkaline
lysis with SDS (Birnboim & Doly, 1979). Plasmid DNA may then be purified
by column chromatography. Commercial kits are available to perform both
of the above.

**ALKALINE LYSIS WITH SDS**

Exposure of bacterial suspensions to a strongly anionic detergent at
high pH ruptures the cells and denatures proteins and chromosomes. The
cell walls, proteins and chromosomal DNA become enmeshed in large
complexes that are coated with dodecyl sulphate. When potassium ions are
added (to replace sodium ions), these complexes precipitate out, leaving
plasmid DNA in solution. Therefore plasmid DNA can be recovered from the
supernatant after centrifugation.

During the lysis phase, the alkaline pH completely disrupts
base-pairing. However, stands of closed circular plasmid DNA are unable
to separate from each other as they are topologically intertwined. The
DNA strands fall back into register when the pH returns to normal
(provided that the duration and / or intensity of OH ^--^ exposure is
not too great).

**COLUMN CHROMATOGRAPHY**

Most kits use resins capable of ion-exchange / adsorption interaction
chromatography. This process exploits the propensity of DNA to bind to
silica in the presence of chaotropic salts. These salts are thought to
dehydrate the sugar-phosphate backbone of dsDNA, permitting exposed
PO~4~ ^3--^ residues to adsorb to the silicate matrix. Once adsorbed,
the dsDNA cannot be eluted by solvents (e.g. 50 % EtOH) that displace
other biopolymers such as RNA and carbohydrates. When the dsDNA is
rehydrated by washing with an aqueous buffer (e.g. TE / H~2~O) then it
can be recovered in the effluent. The adsorption of dsDNA to the
silicate matrix is independent of base composition and topology (and
therefore this method can be used to purify circular plasmid or long
linear DNA) but is dependant on DNA fragment length. Fragments less then
100 -- 200 bp adsorb poorly to the resin and this method is not suitable
for their purification.

**COMBINED KIT**

Commercial kits differ in the chemical composition of the binding resin
(which is usually supplied pre-packed in columns) and the chemical
reagents used with them. Most protocols include the following steps:

i\) grow E. coli to sufficient numbers

ii\) harvest bacteria by centrifuging and re-suspending pellet (to form
a homogenous cell suspension)

iii\) lyse cells (with alkaline lysis with SDS)

iv\) prepare DNA and column for chromatography

v\) bind DNA to binding resin

vi\) wash other biopolymers away

vii\) elute DNA

viii\) concentrate DNA (if required)
