**Transformation of E. coli by electroporation**

**Experimental design**

*Include -- ve controls to exclude contamination; + ve control to
measure transformation efficiency.*

*Adjust DNA concentrations to appropriate target ranges. Expect
transformation efficiency for subcloned plasmids to be two orders of
magnitude less than for supercoiled circular plasmid DNA*[^1]*.*

**-- ve controls** an aliquot of competent cells to which no DNA is
added

non-inoculated plate

**+ ve control** an aliquot of competent cells with known amount of
circular superhelical plasmid DNA[^2]

**Electroporation**

*Keep everything on ice @ all times*[^3]*.*

*Have naked flame to sterilise glassware. Have waste pot with Vircon in
it.*

i\) pre-warm agar plates @ 37 ° × 30 -- 60 mins

ii\) select E. coli Electroporation Cuvettes (2 mm gap; blue top) and
place on ice

put 1.5 ml Eppendorfs on ice

thaw on ice × 10 mins

iv\) dilute ligation mixture 1:5 in H~2~O[^8][^9]

prepare plasmid dilution for + ve control

v\) put 1 μl of DNA into 1.5 ml Eppendorf

vi\) flick cells to resuspend

add 40 μl of cells

pipette up and down to mix

dispense into cuvette

tap cuvette on desk to ensure base is covered with liquid (or else risk
arcing)

vii\) transfer samples on ice bucket to bug room

viii\) dry outside of cuvette

load cradle of Easyject Plus[^10]

ensure cradle lid closed

ensure control box settings correct (usually c. 2300 V)[^11]

ix\) press run

wait for bleep then bleep--bleep--bleep[^12]

x\) add 960 μl SOC medium, pipette to mix and transfer to 15 ml Falcon
tube[^13][^14]

xi\) incubate @ 37 ° × 200 rpm × 30 -- 60 mins (tops on tight)

xii\) dilute or concentrate samples if required[^15]

xiii\) dispense 100 μl onto pre-warmed agar plate

spread round dish with sterile spreader aiming for even coverage

keep at RT ° until all liquid is absorbed

invert plates and incubate overnight @ 37 °

[^1]: ideally DNA to be electroporated should be resuspended @ c. 1 --
    10 ng μl ^--1^; for superhelical plasmids 10 -- 50 pg of DNA are
    adequate (in 1 μl); for ligation mixtures generated when subcloning
    into a plasmid, use up to 25 ng of DNA (in 1 μl)

[^2]: this allows transformation efficiency to be standardised in terms
    of cfu per μg DNA of a given plasmid

[^3]: transformation is 100-fold more efficient @ 0 -- 4 ° compared to
    RT °

[^4]: use pre-prepared bottles of SOC medium (but recipe is also in
    Sambrook & Russell)

[^5]: some people believe that pre-warmed SOC medium delivers a
    heat-shock stimulus that increases transformation efficiency

[^6]: electrocompetent E. coli are grown to mid-log phase, chilled,
    washed extensively in ice-cold water and suspended in 10% glycerol
    (to prevent cell lysis by ice crystals)

[^7]: stored in box @ back of Audrey's tray in -- 80 ° by NEB catalogue
    \# (NEB C2989K is DH5α derivative, stock has been diluted 1:2 in
    glycerol; use DH5α for small bits of DNA; DH10β for large
    constructs)

[^8]: ligation mix must be diluted firstly to reduce the contaminating
    effects of salts, proteins and ligase (which reduce transformation
    efficiency), secondly to avoid high ionic strength solutions (which
    may pre-dispose to arcing) and thirdly to bring DNA concentrations
    into the target range; therefore EITHER dilute ligation reaction
    1:5, 1:10 or 1:20 in H~2~O OR purify DNA by or spun-column
    chromatography or phenol:chloroform extraction and precipitation
    with EtOH / ammonium acetate and then resuspend in TE (pH 8) or
    H~2~O to the desired concentration

[^9]: could consider heat-inactivating ligation reactions (@ 65 ° × 20
    mins)

[^10]: electroporation apparatus = power box (to generate charge),
    cradle (to house cuvette) and control box

[^11]: ideal settings are: 25 μF capacitance, 2.5 kV, 200Ω resistance
    giving a time-constant of 4 -- 5 ms with field strength of 12.5 kVcm
    ^--1^

[^12]: the risk of arcing is increased by solutions with high ionic
    strength, higher temperatures and air bubbles

[^13]: this step should be performed relatively quickly; a one minute
    delay can cause a 3-fold reduction in transformation efficiency

[^14]: can put pipette tip back into cuvette instead of waste bucket

[^15]: avoid plating the entire bacterial culture on a single plate as
    the large numbers of dead bacteria will inhibit the growth rate of
    transformants; therefore for superhelical plasmids (where abundant
    transformants expected) either streak a sterile loop or dilute the
    cells 1:10 and 1:100 into 1 ml SOC medium and plate 100 μl of each
    onto separate plates (i.e. plate 1:100 and 1:1000 of total sample
    respectively); for subcloned plasmids (where small numbers of
    transformants expected) plate 100 -- 200 μl of undiluted total
    sample per plate (i.e. 1:10 -- 1:5 of total sample respectively); if
    very small numbers of transformants expected then the sample can be
    concentrated by pelleting the cells (e.g. pulse to 13000 rpm for max
    total 20 s), resuspending in 100 -- 200 μl supernatant and plating
    this but do not overspin as this will rupture cells
