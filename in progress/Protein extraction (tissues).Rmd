**Protein extraction from tissues**

Method derived from that used by Knepper (Na *et al.*, 2003) and from
Matt's lab-book / Ali's thesis.

**Solutions**

*PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) is stable in isopropanol and can
be stored for months at 4 °C. It is unstable in H~2~O (t ~1/2~ = 30 --
60 mins) -- therefore add PMSF / protease inhibitors fresh each time.*

Make up PMSF stock (2 mg ml ^--\ 1^):

PMSF 50 mg

in isopropanol 25 ml

Make up protein isolation solution as follows:

250 mM sucrose = 4.28 g

10 mM triethanolamine = 66.7 mcl of 99 % stock (c. 7.54 M)

0.1 mg ml ^--\ 1^ PMSF = 2.5 ml of 2 mg ml ^--\ 1^ stock

in dH~2~O 45 ml

pH to 7.6

top up to 50 ml

to each 10 ml aliquot, add one protease inhibitor tablet (Roche)

**Procedure**

i\) place tissue to be homogenised (e.g. ½ liver or ½ kidney) in 2 ml
eppendorf (and thaw on ice)

add c. 1.5 ml ice-cold isolation solution

ii\) homogenise in mixer-mill (90s @ top speed)

(can spin briefly @ 2 × 10 ^3^ rpm to confirm successful homogenisation)

iii\) leave on ice for 15'

iv\) determine protein concentration in 1:10 dilution in aq (isopropanol
interferes with assay) using BCA assay

read absorbance @ 562 nm
